        Plots of the reward, between steps 100,000 and 200,000, given some input
        parameter, averaged over 2,000 runs. 'e-greedy<.1>' and '<1/N>' are e-greedy
        agents with a constant .1 and averaging step size, respectively. 'op-greedy' is a
        greedy agent that has been initialized with optimistic estimates. 'UCB' is a
        greedy agent that overvalues uncertain actions. Finally, 'gradient' is
        non-greedy, selecting actions according to a softmax distribution. The symbol in
        parenthesis after each is the name of their input parameters, which vary over the
        x axis.
